## How it Works ?
It first registers a user's account and health official's accounts (like doctors) and it makes the interaction between the user and health officials simple and easy.
It helps the user to make appointments with certain doctors that are filtered through the search in online MedTech. It also gives almost complete medical data of the 
user to the doctor. It makes it easier to analyze the condition of the user. It also helps the doctor to analyze possible heriditery conditions through the registered
family members of the user(patient). And this website also sells doctor approved medical equipments. We can also look at the real-time WHO news. The website MedTech 
isn't complete, it's just a front-end which is actually imperfect. This website mainly focuses on grouping different online facilities into one. It is basically just 
doctor-patient social media where the user is either a doctor or a patient. It let them have full control over showing their details to  a third person. We can 
only access the information only by the user's approval.
